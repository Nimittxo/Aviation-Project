To create API endpoints that interact with the database for your aviation project, you'll need to handle CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). We'll use the Flask web framework for this example, but you can adapt the principles to other frameworks as well. Here's how you can set up API endpoints for airline data as an illustration:

Install Required Libraries:
First, ensure that you have Flask and SQLite (or your chosen database library) installed. If not, you can install them as follows:

bash
Copy code
pip install Flask
pip install sqlite3
Set Up a Flask App:
Create a Flask application and define your API endpoints. Here's a simple example:

python
Copy code
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import sqlite3

app = Flask(__name__)

# Define a function to create a database connection
def get_db_connection():
    conn = sqlite3.connect('mydatabase.db')
    conn.row_factory = sqlite3.Row
    return conn

@app.route('/api/airlines', methods=['GET'])
def get_airlines():
    try:
        conn = get_db_connection()
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM airlines')
        airlines = cursor.fetchall()
        conn.close()
        return jsonify([dict(row) for row in airlines])
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify({'error': str(e)})

@app.route('/api/airlines/<int:id>', methods=['GET'])
def get_airline(id):
    try:
        conn = get_db_connection()
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM airlines WHERE id = ?', (id,))
        airline = cursor.fetchone()
        conn.close()
        if airline:
            return jsonify(dict(airline))
        else:
            return jsonify({'error': 'Airline not found'})
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify({'error': str(e)})

# Similar routes for Create, Update, and Delete operations

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
CRUD Operations:
In the code above, we've defined routes for the following CRUD operations:

GET /api/airlines: Retrieve a list of all airlines.
GET /api/airlines/<int:id>: Retrieve details for a specific airline by its ID.
You can also define routes for creating, updating, and deleting airlines.
Database Operations:
Inside each route, you establish a database connection using the get_db_connection() function and execute SQL queries to interact with the database.

Run the Flask App:
To start your Flask app, run the Python script:

bash
Copy code
python your_app.py
Replace your_app.py with the name of your Python script.

Test the API Endpoints:
You can use tools like curl, Postman, or a web browser to test your API endpoints. For example, you can send GET requests to retrieve airline data.

This is a simplified example. In a real project, you should include error handling, request validation, and authentication as necessary. Additionally, you can use Flask extensions like Flask-RESTful to simplify API development and structuring.
